Demand for athletic fields will increase so having a good plan in place that is inclusive will be important. Same is true for trails- it is important to have trails that are well designed and give people enough space that they do not create rouge trails in sensitive areas.  Continuing to maintain existing open space and use them for town events is critical to connect people to the natural resources (I think Amesbury does a pretty good job of this).
